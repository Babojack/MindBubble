Keep it Simple – Got something on your mind? Bubble it!

You’ve got a thought? Bubble it up! Want to delete it without any fuss? Just hit that little 'X' and poof—gone! But if you’re feeling a bit more interactive with your... uh, bubbles, then it's time to hit Basketball mode! Toss your thoughts (or balls) into the basket and score some mental points. It's not just organizing your life, it's a game!
